To calculate Transfer Entropy, please place both TE_BC_MS_Media_Gun_Control.m and data0.m files in the same folder, and run 
TE_BC_MS_Media_Gun_Control.m file in Matlab. 

TE_BC_MS_Media_Gun_Control.m file will load the data from data0.m using the data for national level background checks, mass shootings, and media output on gun control.

To change the analysis for different time series, please use the Excel file to replace the data in data0.m

Specific instructions on how to change data, please see comments in data0.m

Details of how the TE calculation is constructed are explained with comments in TE_BC_MS_Media_Gun_Control.m
